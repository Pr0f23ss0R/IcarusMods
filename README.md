# IcarusMods - Pr0fPack WIP

The main goal of this modpack is to make solo gameplay more fun.
I don't have that much time to play the game atm, so please let met know if there are any bugs or if you have any suggestions.
Due to the lack of time I didn't get to the point splitting my mods yet.

The Mod is optimised to run with Jimk's High Jump mod (https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Mods).

All Envirosuits got more Falling Resistance but your char can still get injured.
The adjustment wont be enough for those gravity mods.

DISCLAIMER: these mods are intended for Offline and/or solo play. It can potentially ruin the game for others when playing together, so please do not put yourself in that situation. If you play with a regular group and they all want it, please recommend all parties install the mod to prevent adverse effects.

INSTALLATION: if you do not already have one, you need to create a new folder and name it 'mods' in the following directory - Disk > Program Files (x86) > steamapps > common > Icarus > Icarus > Content > Paks. Download desired .pak files, and drag and drop into the mods folder you created. Good to go!

Please be carfull while testing the modpack!:
If you want to remove the modpack and have a mission running, every stack of items larger than in the original game specified will completely disappear. Also the additional Fuel slots will disappear with their items. Workshop items that are equipped to a char into the space stations should be able to recover by unloading previous ones and restarting the game.
