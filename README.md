# IcarusMods - Pr0fpack Beta

I also don't have that much time to play the game atm, so please let met know if there are any bugs or if you have any suggestions.
Due to the lack of time I didn't got to the point splitting my mods.

Please be carfull while testing the modpack!:
If you want to remove the modpack and have a mission running, every stack of items larger than in the original game will completely disappear. Also the additional Fuel slots will disappear with their items. Workshop items that are equipped to a char into the space stations should be able to recover by unloading previous ones and restarting the game.

This pack changes a lot of commonly used files so it probably won't be compatible with any other modpacks.

approved compatibility:
  - Jimk Camo Textures (https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Mods)
