Pr0fMods

some single mods and a qol-pack can be found in here.

I'd recommend using the Icarus Mod Manager from Jimk72, which can be found here 
https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software

Once the Mods are integrated into the IMM they can be easily installed, merged, updated and removed.
If you need any help, just take a look into the Linkarus Discord communtiy. 

DISCLAIMER: these mods are intended for Offline and/or solo play. It can potentially ruin the game for others when playing together, so please do not put yourself in that situation. If you play with a regular group and they all want it, please recommend all parties install the mod to prevent adverse effects.

DISCLAIMER: these mods are intended for Offline and/or solo play. If you want to run mods with a group, please make sure that all members have the same (version of the) mods installed so that you don't run into any incompatibilities. Those can can cause a lot of different problems.

MANUAL INSTALLATION: if you do not already have one, you need to create a new folder and name it 'mods' in the following directory - Disk > Program Files (x86) > steamapps > common > Icarus > Icarus > Content > Paks. Download desired .pak files, and drag and drop into the mods folder you created. Good to go!
